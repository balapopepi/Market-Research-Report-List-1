<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radar Level Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Through-Air</li><li>Guided-Wave</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Radar level sensors are categorized into two main types: Through-Air and Guided-Wave. Through-Air radar sensors utilize electromagnetic waves that travel from the sensor to the target material and back, making them ideal for measuring levels in a variety of applications, including liquids and solids. Guided-Wave radar sensors, on the other hand, use a probe to guide the radar waves directly to the material's surface. This type is often used in challenging environments, providing accurate measurements in narrow or turbulent conditions.</p></p>
