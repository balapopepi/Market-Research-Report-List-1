<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The HDPE Decking Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Capped composite</li><li>Uncapped composite</li></ul></p>
<p><p>HDPE decking, made from high-density polyethylene, is a durable, eco-friendly material used for outdoor spaces. The market includes capped and uncapped composite types. Capped composite decking features a protective outer layer that enhances resistance to stains, fading, and moisture, making it ideal for high-traffic areas. Uncapped composite decking lacks this layer, offering a more cost-effective option but with less protection against wear and environmental damage. Both types combine HDPE with wood fibers or other materials for strength and sustainability.</p></p>
