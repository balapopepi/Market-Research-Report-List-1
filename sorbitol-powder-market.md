<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sorbitol Powder Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pan-agglomerated Sorbitol</li><li>Spray-dried Sorbitol</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The sorbitol powder market is primarily characterized by two types: pan-agglomerated sorbitol and spray-dried sorbitol. Pan-agglomerated sorbitol is produced through agglomeration, resulting in larger, free-flowing particles that enhance handling and solubility, making it suitable for food and pharmaceutical applications. Conversely, spray-dried sorbitol involves atomizing a liquid sorbitol solution into fine droplets, rapidly drying them to create a powder. This method preserves the inherent properties of sorbitol while providing a lightweight, easily dispersible product ideal for various industrial uses.</p></p>
