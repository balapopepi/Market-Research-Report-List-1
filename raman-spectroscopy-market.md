<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Raman Spectroscopy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Immersion Mode</li><li>Stand-off Mode</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Raman spectroscopy market can be categorized into two primary types: immersion mode and stand-off mode. Immersion mode involves direct physical contact with the sample, providing high sensitivity and resolution for detailed analysis in labs or controlled environments. In contrast, stand-off mode allows for non-contact analysis, enabling remote detection of materials from a distance, useful in security and environmental monitoring applications. Both modes leverage Raman scattering for material identification, but cater to different operational needs and settings.</p></p>
